        <h2 class="section-title">Origin Story</h2>
        <div class="origin-story">
            <p>
                In 2009 I attended Victor Wooten's Music/Nature Camp, eager to study with a musician I had admired for years. I first heard Wooten perform with <strong>Béla Fleck</strong> in Cincinnati and was immediately enthralled—especially when he offered a solo rendition of Bach's <em>Cello Suite No. 1</em>, a piece I had explored on trombone. When he began improvising on its themes, I knew I had found a musical hero, and that moment ultimately led me to his camp.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Camp instruction looked nothing like traditional music education. Victor began by attuning our minds to listening: half the sessions were outdoors, training us to notice details we usually miss and to connect fully with the world around us. Group playing carried the same focus—step out of your head, pay close attention to what others are doing, and make them sound better so you sound better too. <strong>Joe Craven led forty‑five minutes of free improvisation with the entire group—electric, inspiring, and proof that a shared groove can make improvisers out of everyone.</strong> I watched a woman who had never played bass sit in with the band and sound like a pro, and I saw a technically clean guitar solo reborn when Victor helped the player shift from "trying to sound great" to simply <em>feeling the groove</em>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Since that initial experience I have been exploring how to bring this way of attending to music into both private lessons and group programs. I ran <strong>Island Beat Music‑Nature Camps</strong> for three summers on Mercer Island, launched the first <strong>Creative Kids Music Project</strong> in Renton, WA, and later directed <strong>UpBeat</strong> in New Hampshire. With each season I've iterated and refined Victor's lessons—testing what sparks immediate musical joy, seeing what falls flat, and discovering how to give children (and adults) an experience that leaves them wanting more, then using that spark to fuel ongoing exploration and growth.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #5a7c3a;">
                The Vancouver‑based Creative Kids Music Project is the latest—and most complete—expression of that journey. Here, nature‑inspired listening games, multi‑instrument exploration, and groove‑first ensemble work converge to help young musicians discover not just how music sounds but how it <em>feels</em>.

                <p>Neuroscience shows music lights up motor, language, and emotion centers at once. Students learn to <strong>zoom in</strong> with their thinking mind to polish details, then <strong>zoom out</strong> with their creative mind to enter the space where "mistakes" become new ideas. They use their whole selves—and each part supports the other.</p>

                <p>
                    I grew up in a small Michigan town, playing trombone in the school band, leading my youth‑group band on guitar, and writing songs to perform with friends in a local garage outfit. College added classical studies in voice, piano, and trombone—and a conviction that music thrives when genres and settings collide. Over the last 25 years I've worked as a church musician, choir director, and private teacher, guiding students of all ages on piano, voice, guitar, trombone, and drums. When I'm not making music you'll find me in the mountains, on the sea, or on a meditation cushion—often with my two amazing kids (ages 9 and 13). These experiences shape the Creative Kids Music Project, where nature, mindfulness, and joyful exploration meet solid musical craft.
