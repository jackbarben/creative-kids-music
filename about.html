            <p>
                The spark for everything I do now was lit in 2009, deep in the Tennessee woods, when I attended Victor Wooten's Music / Nature Camp. I had followed his music for years and was thrilled to meet and study with him. My first glimpse of his genius had come at a Béla Fleck concert in Cincinnati, where Victor paused mid‑set to play Bach's Cello Suite No. 1, a piece I knew well from my own trombone practice. Then he slipped off the written page and began to improvise around its themes, and in that instant he became a musical hero.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The camp itself turned every idea I held about music lessons upside down. Victor asked us to notice how we were using our minds as we played. Half our sessions took place outdoors, where we engaged in practices to notice all of the details we normally miss. Music sessions were about how to use our attention to guide our listening, transforming our music making instantaneously. This experience started me on a journey to transform my own teaching and bring the wonder and inspiration I had experienced there to my students.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Ever since that week I have tried to carry the same spirit into my own teaching. I started the Island Beat Music / Nature Camps on Mercer Island, launched the first Creative Kids Music Project in Renton, Washington, and later directed UpBeat kids music project in New Hampshire. Each iteration I experimented. I noted what sparked instant joy, what fell flat, and what kept students—young and old—coming back hungry for more.
            </p>
            
            <p style="font-weight: 600; color: #5a7c3a;">
                Today that journey has led me to Vancouver to begin again with the Creative Kids Music Project at St Luke's. My goal is to help every student discover the musician within and to learn how to nurture and cultivate that side of themselves in every part of their life.

                <h3>Play and Practice Together</h3>
                <p>Fun and discipline feed each other. We play to spark curiosity, let curiosity lead us into practice, and use practice to unlock new ways to play—the cycle keeps momentum and joy alive.</p>

                <h3>Neuroscience: Zoom In, Zoom Out</h3>
                <p>Music lights up movement, language, and emotion at once. We learn to notice the different parts of the mind and how each one shapes the music‑making process. We zoom in to polish tricky passages, then zoom out to find our place in the groove and slip into flow. Detail work and big‑picture listening strengthen each other.</p>

                <p>
                    Jack began piano at age 5 and has spent a lifetime exploring music across genres and cultures. His classical training includes studies at Cedarville University, Aspen Music Festival, and Peabody Conservatory, complemented by explorations in Hindustani voice and West African drumming. He plays piano, trombone, guitar, organ, drums, bansuri flute, and whatever else makes sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With over 25 years of teaching experience, Jack has developed an approach that draws out the natural musicality in every student. Inspired by Victor Wooten and Joe Craven, he believes music is a language best learned through jamming, play, and community. His innovative programs include Island Beat Music/Nature Camps and multiple iterations of the Creative Kids Music Project. When not making music, you'll find him in the mountains, on the sea, or on a meditation cushion—often with his two amazing kids.
