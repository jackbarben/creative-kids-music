## New This Year: Creative Kids Music Program (After School)

This fall, we're launching a brand-new, 4-day-a-week music immersion program for children:
**The Creative Kids Music Program.**

### Program Schedule:

- **Days:** Monday through Thursday
- **Time:** After school until 5:30 p.m., with optional childcare until 6:00 p.m.
- **Outdoor Play:** Children arriving directly from nearby schools can relax and play outside until all participants have arrived.
- **Transportation:** We are exploring the possibility of offering pick-up from local schools within a one-mile radius (pending interest and availability).

### What Is It?

Have you ever wanted to be a musician?
Pick up an instrument and just play?
Sing your own songs? Improvise? Compose?

This program is built around that dream. Children will learn how to:

- Sing and make music with confidence
- Play a variety of instruments
- Understand how music works from the inside out
- Collaborate and create original compositions
- Develop strong rhythm, pitch, and listening skills
- Read music, write music, and make music their own

From the very beginning, kids will explore improvisation, creativity, and composition alongside traditional skills. It's a group-based, multi-instrument, joy-filled program that gives your child a truly strong foundation—not just to play an instrument, but to become a whole musician.

### Who's It For?

- Open to children in grades K–6
- No previous experience required—just curiosity and enthusiasm!
- Great for kids already taking lessons and those completely new to music

This is an elite-level training program—but it's not exclusive. All are welcome.
We believe in high standards, and we believe every child deserves access to excellence in music education.
