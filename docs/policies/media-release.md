## Photo and Video Consent

During Creative Kids Music programs, we may photograph or record video of activities for various purposes. This document explains how media may be used and your consent options.

### How We Use Photos and Videos

**Full Consent** allows use for:
- Website and social media (Instagram, Facebook, etc.)
- Promotional materials (flyers, brochures, advertisements)
- Press releases and media coverage
- Internal communications and archives
- Parent sharing platforms (private galleries)

**Limited Consent** allows use for:
- Internal communications and archives only
- Private parent sharing platforms
- Staff training purposes
- Not used for any public-facing marketing

**No Consent** means:
- We will make reasonable efforts to exclude your child from photos and videos
- Your child may still appear incidentally in group shots
- No photos of your child will be used for marketing purposes

### Your Rights

1. **Change Anytime**: You may update your media consent preference at any time through your parent account or by contacting us.

2. **No Impact on Participation**: Your consent choice does not affect your child's ability to participate in programs.

3. **Existing Materials**: If you change from Full to Limited or No consent, we will make reasonable efforts to remove previously published materials, though we cannot guarantee removal from all platforms.

4. **Group Photos**: For group photos where exclusion is impractical, we will use discretion and may crop or blur if requested.

### Privacy Protections

- We never publish children's last names publicly
- We never disclose personal information alongside photos
- We review all materials before publication
- We use secure, access-controlled platforms for parent sharing
- We comply with COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) requirements

### Duration

This consent remains in effect for the duration of your child's participation in Creative Kids Music programs and for a reasonable period afterward for archival purposes. Marketing use of specific images will be reviewed annually.
