## Overview

We understand that plans change. This policy outlines how cancellations are handled for Creative Kids Music programs.

## Cancellation Policy

### Before Payment

You may cancel your registration at any time before payment with no penalty. Your spot will be released for other families.

### After Payment

**No refunds are issued after payment has been received.**

You may still cancel your registration after payment if your plans change. This frees up your spot for other families, but no refund will be provided.

## Adding or Removing Children

### Adding Children

You can add children to an existing registration through your parent account before the program starts:

- Additional child fee applies
- Sibling discount applied automatically ($10 off per additional child)
- Payment due before program starts

### Removing Children

You can remove children from an existing registration before the program starts:

- If you haven't paid yet, your total will be recalculated (sibling discount adjusts accordingly)
- **If you have already paid, no refund will be issued** for the removed child
- If you remove all children from a registration, this is treated as a cancellation

### Cutoff for Changes

All changes to your registration (adding children, removing children, editing child information, or cancelling) must be made **before midnight Pacific Time on the first day of your program**.

- For workshops: midnight before the first workshop date in your registration
- For summer camp: midnight before the first day of camp

If you cannot attend, please cancel your registration so we can offer your spot to other families.
