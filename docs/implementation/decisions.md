## Decisions

### 2024-12-19 - Design Style Selection

**Context**: Phase 1 required building 3 distinct design styles and selecting a winner before proceeding with the full site build.

**Options Considered**:
1. **Modern Playful** - Clean, contemporary with teal/coral. Professional, high parent appeal.
2. **Warm & Organic** - Forest green, terracotta, cream. Nurturing, natural, continues current brand.
3. **Bold & Energetic** - Electric purple, hot pink, dark mode. High kid appeal, very unique.

**Decision**: **Warm & Organic** (Style 2)

**Rationale**:
- Maintains continuity with the existing brand identity
- Warm, nurturing aesthetic matches the program's philosophy
- Appeals to parents (decision makers) while remaining kid-friendly
- Cream/forest/terracotta palette feels natural and approachable
- Fraunces + Nunito typography is distinctive yet readable

**Impact**:
- Home page uses Warm & Organic design
- Color palette: cream, forest green, terracotta
- Typography: Fraunces (display), Nunito (body)
- All future pages will follow this design system
